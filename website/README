About
=====

The website build generates the static-HTML project website.


Dependencies
============

The same Java and Gradle dependencies as the Juzidian Core build requirements,
plus:

 * rsync (for site publishing only)


Building
========

Note: Gradle commands should be invoked from the top-level project.

 * Generate the site:

	$ gradle -c website-settings.gradle build


Publishing
==========

Note: Gradle commands should be invoked from the top-level project.

 * Publish generated site to network server:

	$ gradle -c website-settings.gradle publish

   Note: the rsync publishing mechanism does not remove deleted files. Removal
   of files from the remote server requires manual intervention.


Alternative Server
==================

The generated site can be published to an alternative server by specifying a
build profile which defines alternative site publication configuration. For
example, to publish to the server defined in the "dev" profile:

	$ gradle -c website-settings.gradle -Pprofile=dev publish
